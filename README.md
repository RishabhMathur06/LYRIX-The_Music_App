# LYRIX-The_Music_App
This is a web development project in which I have created a Music Application just like Spotify, Apple Music or Shazam. This project contains a player which is fully functional and shows the current playing song also, we may select the next song, previous song, repeat the song, etc. Built using: React, Redux, Tailwind CSS and RapidAPI.
